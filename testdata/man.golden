.TH BJ 1 "January 2026" "bj 0.3" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
bj \- background jobs manager (and so much more)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bj
.RI [ options ]
.I command
.PP
Look, you're reading a man page. That's adorable. But honestly?
.B bj \-\-help
is right there, waiting for you. It's faster, it's always up to date, and
it doesn't require piping through
.BR man (1)
like some kind of animal.
.PP
But fine. You want the \fIfull experience\fR. Let's do this.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bj
is a lightweight CLI tool that handles your commands in the background so you
can focus on more... \fIpressing\fR matters. It uses
.BR setsid (2)
to fully detach processes, ensuring they keep going long after you've
moved on. Some might call that stamina.
.PP
Give bj a command and it'll handle the rest while you sit back and relax.
No strings attached. Well, no \fIterminal\fR attached.
.SH "A GENTLE SUGGESTION"
Before we go any further, have you considered
.B bj \-\-init fish
or
.BR "bj \-\-init zsh" ?
The shell integration gives you tab completion that \fIanticipates your needs\fR.
It's like bj reading your mind, but for command-line arguments.
.PP
And if you want help on a specific command, try something like:
.PP
.RS
.nf
bj \-\-list \-\-help
bj \-\-retry \-\-help
.fi
.RE
.PP
Each command has its own detailed help. It's intimate. Personal. Much better
than this impersonal wall of text you're currently squinting at.
.PP
But you're still here. I respect the commitment.
.SH OPTIONS
These are the highlights. For the \fIreal\fR details, use
.B \-\-help
on individual commands. They'll treat you right.
.TP
.B \-\-list
See what bj has been up to. Add
.BR \-\-running ", " \-\-failed ", or " \-\-done
to filter by... performance.
.TP
.BI \-\-logs " [id]"
Watch bj's output. Every moan, groan, and triumphant success message.
Defaults to the most recent job if you can't remember which one.
.TP
.BI \-\-kill " [id]"
Sometimes you need to stop things abruptly. No judgment.
.TP
.BR \-\-retry [ =\fIN\fR ]
bj doesn't give up easily. Use alone to retry a ruined job, or with a
command to keep trying until satisfaction (or N attempts, whichever comes first).
.TP
.BI \-\-delay " secs"
Pace yourself. Wait between retry attempts.
.TP
.B \-\-prune
Clean up when bj is finished. Removes completed jobs and their logs.
A tidy bj is a happy bj.
.TP
.B \-\-gc
Find jobs that were unexpectedly ruined. Sometimes things end badly
without warning. This helps you find closure.
.TP
.B \-\-json
For the robots among us. Or if you're piping to
.BR jq (1)
like a sophisticated individual.
.TP
.BR \-\-init " fish" | zsh
.B "You should really do this."
Sets up shell integration with completions and a prompt function.
Your future self will thank you. Your present self might even feel things.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
The \fIactual\fR way to get help. Faster, more contextual, and doesn't
require you to remember how your system's
.BR man (1)
works. Use
.B bj <command> \-\-help
for the good stuff.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
.RS
.nf
bj npm install            # Let bj handle your package needs
bj \-\-retry npm test       # Keep going until it passes
bj \-\-list                 # Check on bj's progress
bj \-\-logs                 # See the latest output
bj \-\-kill                 # Stop it right there
bj \-\-prune                # Clean up after a satisfying session
.fi
.RE
.PP
But really, just type
.B bj
and press tab a few times. The shell integration makes this \fIso\fR much better.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I ~/.config/bj/
Where bj keeps its private data. Jobs, logs, configuration. Don't be weird about it.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
.RS
.nf
# ~/.config/bj/bj.toml
log_dir = "logs"
viewer = "less"
auto_prune_hours = 24
.fi
.RE
.PP
See the example config at
.I https://github.com/metruzanca/bj
for all the options, lovingly commented.
.SH "SHELL INTEGRATION (SERIOUSLY, DO THIS)"
.SS Fish
.PP

echo 'bj \-\-init fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
.fi
.RE

.fi
.RE
.PP
This gives you tab completion and a
.B __bj_prompt_info
function that shows how many jobs are currently... active.
.PP
You'll wonder how you ever lived without it. It's transformative.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.B 0
if bj finishes happily.
.B 1
if something goes wrong. Check the output for details.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR nohup (1)
(if you enjoy suffering),
.BR screen (1)
(if you enjoy complexity),
.BR tmux (1)
(okay, tmux is actually pretty good)
.SH BUGS
Report issues at https://github.com/metruzanca/bj/issues
.PP
Or just use
.B \-\-help
next time. It's right there. Always ready. Unlike this man page, which
required you to pipe things and probably Google the syntax for your OS.
.SH AUTHOR
Written with love, sass, and a little help from AI.
.SH "FINAL THOUGHTS"
You made it to the end of a man page. That's... a choice. The same information
is available via
.B bj \-\-help
in a fraction of the time, with colors and everything.
.PP
But hey, there's something to be said for the classics.
