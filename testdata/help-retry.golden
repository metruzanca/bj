bj --retry - Keep going until bj finishes the job

Usage:
  bj --retry[=N] [--delay S] <command>   Run a new command with retry
  bj --retry[=N] [--delay S] [--id ID]   Retry an existing ruined job

The --retry flag can be used two ways:
  1. With a command: runs the command, retrying on failure
  2. Without a command: retries an existing ruined job

Options:
  --retry         Keep teasing until success (no limit)
  --retry=N       Stop after N attempts (deny after N tries)
  --delay S       Wait S seconds between attempts (default: 1)
  --id ID         Specify which ruined job to retry (defaults to most recent)
  --json          Output job info as JSON

Examples:
  bj --retry npm test              Keep running tests until they pass
  bj --retry=3 make build          Try building up to 3 times
  bj --retry --delay 5 curl ...    Wait 5 seconds between attempts
  bj --retry                       Retry the most recent ruined job
  bj --retry --id 5                Retry job #5 until success
  bj --retry=3 --delay 10 --id 5   Retry job #5 up to 3 times, 10s apart
