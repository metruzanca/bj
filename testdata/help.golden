bj - Background Jobs

Give bj a command and it'll handle the rest while you sit back and relax.

Usage:
  bj <command>              Slip a command in the background
  bj --retry[=N] <command>  Run with retry until success (or N attempts)
  bj --restart <command>    Run with infinite restart on failure (5s delay)
  bj --list                 See what bj is working on
  bj --logs [id]            Watch bj's performance
  bj --kill [id]            Stop a job mid-action
  bj --retry[=N] [--id ID]  Retry a ruined job
  bj --prune                Clean up when bj is finished
  bj --gc                   Find jobs that were ruined unexpectedly

Shell Integration:
  bj --completion <sh>  Output shell completions (fish, zsh)
  bj --init <sh>        Output prompt integration (fish, zsh)
  bj --man              Output manual page (pipe to man for viewing)

  --retry[=N]         Keep trying until success (or limit to N attempts)
  --restart           Restart command on failure after 5s (infinite loop)
  --id ID             Specify job ID for --retry (defaults to most recent)
  --json              Output in JSON format (works with all commands)
  -h, --help          Show this help (use with commands for detailed help)
